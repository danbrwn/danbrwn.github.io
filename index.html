            <h3>Automated Documenting ControlLogix PLC Functional Descriptions</h3>
            <p>Developed a series of Node.js scripts to document and validate ControlLogix PLC functional descriptions,
                translating complex PLC logic into understandable formats.</p>

            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Updating functional descriptions after 15 years of changes across
                approximately 50 PLCs, and validating settings against best practices, all while making the information
                comprehensible for users who cannot evaluate PLC rungs directly.</p>

            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ControlLogix PLC to Boolean Expressions:</strong> Wrote a Node.js script to parse
                    ControlLogix L5K export programs into boolean equivalent statements, using complex regular
                    expressions.</li>
                <li><strong>Boolean Expression to Natural Language Using OpenAI API:</strong> Developed a Node.js script
                    to translate boolean language statements into a natural language synopsis, providing a comprehensive
                    explanation of operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Document Alarm Values ControlLogix PLC:</strong> Created a Node.js script to extract digital
                    and analog alarm block parameters from ControlLogix exported files, simplifying the documentation
                    and validation process for a large set of alarms.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The combined efforts allowed for accurate documentation, validation, and
                explanation of complex PLC code, making it accessible and understandable for end users. This streamlined
                the process of updating and validating the PLC functional descriptions.</p>

        Logical expression:${cleanedExpression}
        Additionally, provide a textual flowchart with conditions and actions based on the logical expression. 
        Each condition should be clearly defined and include the logical steps leading to the final action and retain the OR and AND keywords between steps.
        Parentheses in the code should be evaluated as grouping statements for consideration as a whole.
        Nested parentheses should indicate order of operations with inner most evaluated first.
        Within enclosing parentheses AND conditions represents sequential actions and OR conditions branching conditions.
        Conditions should be evaluated from left to right and inner parenthesis to outer parenthesis.
        In evaluation order of operations OR represents a branching of logic and AND a joining condition.
        Tag descriptions are designated with the following pattern tag|description where the | character is the delimiter.
        Include the tag and descriptions in both the descriptive and flowchart outputs.
