        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>ControlLogix PLC to Boolean Expressions</h3>
            <p>Developed an application to parse ControlLogix L5K export programs into boolean equivalent statements.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Functional descriptions of operations needed updating after 15 years of changes. Users could not evaluate PLC rungs. Going through PLC rung by rung for approximately 50 PLCs would have been extremely time-consuming.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I wrote a Node.js application to parse strings using complex regular expressions, converting ControlLogix statements into boolean expressions.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The code allowed validation of the functions against the PLC code, providing the end-user with understandable boolean expressions for complex PLC code.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <pre>
        // Step 5: Ensure AND between tags like CommMatrix[5].RXDataBytes[0].3 CommMatrix[5].RXDataBytes[0].8
        // This regex ensures there is an " AND " between such tags if they are adjacent without any separator.
        line = line.replace(/(\w+\[\d+\]\.\w+\[\d+\]\.\d+)\s+(?=\w+\[\d+\]\.\w+\[\d+\]\.\d+)/g, '$1 AND ');
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Boolean Expression to Natural Language Using OpenAI API</h3>
            <p>Developed a Node.js script to translate boolean language statements into a natural language synopsis of operations.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Provide a more comprehensive explanation of boolean logic to better explain operations.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I wrote a program to interface with the OpenAI API and trained the model to produce accurate results. I developed prompts tailored to generate natural language explanations corresponding to PLC code rungs from ControlLogix PLC.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The code performed well, but it was ultimately decided that the target audience was sufficiently supported by the original boolean conversion.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <pre>
        const prompt = `Evaluate the following logical expression and provide a plain English explanation. 
        Here are the definitions of the terms used:${mappingsString}
        The expression includes tag names and descriptions separated by a '|' character. For example, 'R77M2|BAGHOUSE ID MOT COOL F1..MOK' means the tag name is 'R77M2' and the description is 'BAGHOUSE ID MOT COOL F1..MOK'.
        Logical expression:${cleanedExpression}
        Additionally, provide a textual flowchart with conditions and actions based on the logical expression. 
        Each condition should be clearly defined and include the logical steps leading to the final action and retain the OR and AND keywords between steps.
        Parentheses in the code should be evaluated as grouping statements for consideration as a whole.
        Nested parentheses should indicate order of operations with inner most evaluated first.
        Within enclosing parentheses AND conditions represents sequential actions and OR conditions branching conditions.
        Conditions should be evaluated from left to right and inner parenthesis to outer parenthesis.
        In evaluation order of operations OR represents a branching of logic and AND a joining condition.
        Tag descriptions are designated with the following pattern tag|description where the | character is the delimiter.
        Include the tag and descriptions in both the descriptive and flowchart outputs.
        Plain English output should be designated as 'Plain English Explanation:'.
        Flowchart output should be designated as 'Textual Flowchart:'.`;
        return prompt;

            <h3>Power Monitoring Application</h3>
            <p>I developed a power monitoring application that collects data via Modbus and CIP using Node.js. The front-end is built with Angular and Material Design, offering a user-friendly interface for monitoring power usage. The system stores data in the cloud for easy access and reporting, providing critical insights into energy consumption.</p>
